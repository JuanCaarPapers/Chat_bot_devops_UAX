The National Science Foundation’s National Optical-Infrared Astronomy Research Laboratory – also known as NOIRLab – published a notice on Tuesday night explaining that the lab had discovered an attempted cyberattack on its systems that morning.  The attack forced the “suspension of astronomical observations at Gemini North in Hawai'i.” Located in Maunakea, Gemini North is one of the Gemini Observatory's two telescopes, with the other in Chile, and is an international science partnership between the U.S., Canada, Chile, Brazil, Argentina and South Korea.

“Quick reactions by the NOIRLab cyber security team and observing teams prevented damage to the observatory. Out of an abundance of caution we have decided to isolate the Gemini Observatory computer systems by shutting them down,” the organization said.    Both the telescopes in Hawai'i and in Cerro Pachón, Chile have been shut down as the IT team investigates the incident and “develops the recovery plan in consultation with NSF’s cyber specialists.”

icsstrive.com,"On April 14, 2023, in the early morning hours, the Port of Halifax in Nova Scotia and the Ports of Montreal and Quebec suffered a “distributed denial of service” (DDOS) cyberattack. Unlike ransomware attacks, these attacks flood network servers with so much internet traffic that it overwhelms a website, rendering it inaccessible or useless for legitimate users. The attacks appeared to be directed at the ports’ websites, causing them to crash for several hours. Further, Quebec’s state-owned electricity provider Hydro-Quebec also experienced a similar cyber assault the next morning.

Despite these attacks, it appears none of the ports’ operations or internal systems were impacted by the incident. The Port of Halifax’s spokesperson Lane Ferguson emphasized that their “internal systems continue to operate normally” and “port operations have not been affected.” Similarly, the spokesperson for the Port of Montreal asserted that the port’s security team had confirmed the port operations were unaffected and there was no risk of a data breach.

Several water monitors – which monitor irrigation systems and wastewater treatment systems – were left dysfunctional on Sunday after a cyber attack targeted the monitoring systems.  Specifically, water controllers for irrigating fields in the Jordan Valley were damaged, as were control systems for the Galil Sewage Corporation.

The management for both major systems was pushing all of Sunday morning to work through the issue and bring the systems back into full operation.  Farmers in the region were warned several days prior about suspicions over a planned cyber attack. Some of them, as a result of the warning, disconnected the remote control option for their irrigation systems and switched them to manual operation, instead, to prevent any harm from the attack. Indeed, those who left their systems on remote control were the ones impacted by the attack.

The attack is thought to be part of an annual “hacktivist” campaign that takes place every April, and this year’s attempt at least managed to cause a nuisance for some farms in the Jordan Valley.  The cyber attack is part of an annual campaign called “OpIsrael,” which strikes in April with DDoS attacks and breach attempts on targets in the country.

icsstrive.com,"Ireland’s health service shut down its IT system after experiencing a “significant ransomware attack”.  The incident has affected more than 80% of IT infrastructure, with the loss of key patient information and diagnostics, resulting in severe impacts on the health service and the provision of care. All computer systems were switched off. Doctors, nurses and other workers lost access to systems for patient information, clinical care and laboratories. Emails went down, and staff had to turn to pen and paper.Lab test data had to be handwritten and manually entered - leading to greater risks of mistakes. Thousands of people's healthcare was disrupted. Confidential medical files were also stolen, with hackers threatening to release the data. A response was quickly mobilised internally, and the Irish Defence Forces were called in to help.

HSE commissioned PWC for independent report on the cyber attack: On 18 March, someone in the Irish Health Service Executive (HSE) opened a spreadsheet that had been sent to them by email two days earlier. But the file was compromised with malware. The criminal gang behind the email spent the next two months working their way through the networks.  There were multiple warning signs that they were at work, but no investigation was launched, and that meant a crucial opportunity to intervene was missed, according to the report, and on May 14 the ransomware was released.     Senior staff set up a ""war room"", but the report criticises the lack of preparation or contingency planning for such a loss of systems.  ""The response teams could not initially focus on the highest priority response and recovery tasks due to the lack of preparedness for a widespread disruptive IT event,"" it says.

The attackers demanded payment to restore access to the computer systems,  Then on 20 May, the attackers, for reasons not entirely clear - but perhaps realizing the scale of what was happening - posted a link to a key that would decrypt files.

The event was confirmed by the German government's Federal Office for Information Security (BSI) in an IT security report. Attackers that appeared to particularly target industrial plant personnel, caused plant control components to fail, resulting in an uncontrolled furnace, which eventually caused physical damage to the steel factory.

According to a study issued by the SANS Institute, the hackers used spear-phishing attempts to obtain access to the steel mill network. The email most likely contained an attached document that, when opened, activated the malicious malware onto the system.  The malware then constructed a remote connection point to establish a bridge between the attackers and the targeted industrial network by exploiting vulnerabilities in a targeted operating system. The hackers were able to modify the programmable logic controllers (PLCs) at this stage, jeopardizing the furnace's operations, which further lead to its own physical damage.",N/A,Unknown,3,German Steel Mill,icsstrive.com,No Malware identified,2,N/A,No threat source identified,Unknown,6,No threat source identified,Metals & Mining,Manufacturing,[12],"IT, OT",1,1,0,Hack attack causes ‘massive damage’ at steel works,www.bbc.com,2014,3,18,0,0,0,1,0,0

icsstrive.com,"Ukraine’s security officers said they took down two online surveillance cameras that were allegedly hacked by Russia to spy on air defense forces and critical infrastructure in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv.

The cameras were installed on residential buildings in Kyiv and were initially used by residents to monitor the surrounding area and parking lot. After hacking them, the Russian intelligence services supposedly gained remote access to the cameras, changed their viewing angles, and connected them to YouTube to stream sensitive footage.

According to Ukraine’s security service, SBU, this footage likely helped Russians direct drones and missiles toward Kyiv during a large-scale missile strike against Ukraine on Tuesday. During the attack, Russia fired almost 100 drones and missiles, primarily targeting Kyiv and Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city. At least 5 people were killed, and 129 were injured.
